Many algorithms perform data clustering by compressing the original data into a more compact and interpretable representation,
which can be more easily inspected for the presence of clusters. This, however, can be a risky alternative, because the simplified
representation may contain distortions mainly related to the density information present in the data, which can considerably
act on the clustering results. In order to treat this deficiency, this paper proposes an Adaptive Radius Immune Algorithm
(ARIA), which is capable of maximally preserving the density information after compression by implementing an antibody adaptive
suppression radius that varies inversely with the local density in the space. ARIA is tested with both artificial and real
world problems obtaining a better performance than the aiNet algorithm and showing that preserving the density information
leads to refined clustering results.
